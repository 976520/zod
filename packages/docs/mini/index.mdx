# @zod/mini

@zod/mini is a lightweight alternative to the full Zod library, designed for environments where bundle size is critical. It provides the core validation functionality of Zod with a smaller footprint.

## Installation

<Tabs>
```bash npm
npm install @zod/mini
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @zod/mini
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @zod/mini
```
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

@zod/mini has an API that is largely compatible with the main Zod library, making it easy to switch between them.

<Tabs>
```ts zod
import { z } from "zod";

const User = z.object({
  username: z.string(),
  age: z.number().min(18)
});

const result = User.parse({
  username: "john_doe",
  age: 25
});
```

```ts @zod/mini
import * as z from "@zod/mini";

const User = z.object({
  username: z.string(),
  age: z.number().min(18)
});

const result = User.parse({
  username: "john_doe",
  age: 25
});
```
</Tabs>

## Relationship with @zod/core

@zod/mini is built on top of @zod/core, which provides the essential validation infrastructure. While @zod/core focuses on the core validation engine, @zod/mini adds a more user-friendly API layer on top of it.

The relationship can be visualized as:

```
@zod/core (foundation) → @zod/mini (lightweight API) → zod (full-featured)
```

## Key Differences from Zod

While @zod/mini aims to be API-compatible with Zod, there are some differences to be aware of:

### 1. Import Style

@zod/mini uses a different import style than the main Zod library:

<Tabs>
```ts zod
import { z } from "zod";
```

```ts @zod/mini
import * as z from "@zod/mini";
```
</Tabs>

### 2. Bundle Size

@zod/mini has a significantly smaller bundle size compared to the full Zod library:

| Package | Minified Size | Gzipped Size |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| zod     | ~120KB       | ~30KB        |
| @zod/mini | ~40KB      | ~12KB        |

### 3. Feature Set

@zod/mini includes most of the core validation features of Zod, but omits some of the more advanced features to keep the bundle size small:

✅ Included in @zod/mini:
- All primitive types (string, number, boolean, etc.)
- Objects, arrays, tuples
- Unions and intersections
- Refinements and transformations
- Error handling
- Type inference

❌ Not included in @zod/mini (available only in full Zod):
- Some advanced string validations
- Some specialized types
- Certain utility functions

## Feature Comparison

Here's a detailed comparison of features between @zod/mini and the full Zod library:

| Feature | @zod/mini | Full Zod |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Primitives (string, number, boolean) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Objects | ✅ | ✅ |
| Arrays | ✅ | ✅ |
| Unions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Literals | ✅ | ✅ |
| Enums | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tuples | ✅ | ✅ |
| Records | ✅ | ✅ |
| Maps and Sets | ✅ | ✅ |
| Promises | ✅ | ✅ |
| Refinements | ✅ | ✅ |
| Transformations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Default values | ✅ | ✅ |
| Error formatting | ✅ | ✅ |
| Type inference | ✅ | ✅ |
| Advanced string validations | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full |
| Custom error maps | ✅ | ✅ |
| Recursive types | ✅ | ✅ |
| Branded types | ✅ | ✅ |

## When to Use @zod/mini

@zod/mini is ideal for:

- Frontend applications where bundle size is critical
- Mobile web applications
- Applications targeting low-bandwidth environments
- When you need the core validation functionality of Zod but don't need all the advanced features

Consider using the full Zod library when:

- Bundle size is not a primary concern
- You need access to all advanced features
- You're working in a Node.js environment where bundle size doesn't matter

## Migration Between @zod/mini and Zod

Thanks to the API compatibility between @zod/mini and Zod, migrating between them is usually straightforward:

### From Zod to @zod/mini

<Tabs>
```ts zod
// Before
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number()
});
```

```ts @zod/mini
// After
import * as z from "@zod/mini";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number()
});
```
</Tabs>

### From @zod/mini to Zod

<Tabs>
```ts @zod/mini
// Before
import * as z from "@zod/mini";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number()
});
```

```ts zod
// After
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number()
});
```
</Tabs>

## Examples

### Form Validation

<Tabs>
```ts zod
import { z } from "zod";

const FormSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(3).max(20),
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
  confirmPassword: z.string()
}).refine(data => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords don't match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"]
});
```

```ts @zod/mini
import * as z from "@zod/mini";

const FormSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(3).max(20),
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
  confirmPassword: z.string()
}).refine(data => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords don't match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"]
});
```
</Tabs>

### API Request Validation

<Tabs>
```ts zod
import { z } from "zod";

const UserCreateRequest = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  role: z.enum(["admin", "user", "guest"]),
  metadata: z.record(z.string()).optional()
});

// Express example
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  try {
    const userData = UserCreateRequest.parse(req.body);
    // Process validated data
    res.status(201).json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.errors });
  }
});
```

```ts @zod/mini
import * as z from "@zod/mini";

const UserCreateRequest = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  role: z.enum(["admin", "user", "guest"]),
  metadata: z.record(z.string()).optional()
});

// Express example
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  try {
    const userData = UserCreateRequest.parse(req.body);
    // Process validated data
    res.status(201).json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.errors });
  }
});
```
</Tabs>

## Performance Considerations

@zod/mini is optimized for bundle size, but it maintains similar runtime performance to the full Zod library for most common operations. For extremely performance-critical applications, you may want to benchmark both libraries with your specific use cases.
